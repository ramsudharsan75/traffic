# Traffic Sign Prediction
Sequential Neural Network Model with good accuracy and less losses.General observations indicate that without MaxPooling, the final image resolution increases, hence takes longer to process. In order to process such high resolution image properly, fairly high number of nodes and hidden layer combination is needed. On the other hand if we apply max pooling, having high number of nodes decreases the accuracy due to overfitting. A good balance of number of filter (during convolution), max pooling and number of nodes and hidden layer is needed to get optimum results. Adding dropouts makes the algorithm more robust.
